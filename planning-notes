An app called On Recall

The premise of this app is to find out whether there are things in your position that are on recall. 

I will be utilizing the following API:
https://api.fda.gov/food/enforcement.json?limit=100
With over 100 objects and plenty of attributes

3 Event Listeners
DOMContentLoaded to load in the top 10 most recent items in the US on recall

Leveraging the submit event listener on a form that filters by the states and/or cities

I want to create a highlight effect if you see the item and click it


User Story #1

As a user once I get to the application, I would like to see any 5 ongoing recalls.

Will need to add an event listener for DOMContentLoaded 

that will fetch the data and report back if the "status" is Ongoing and limited to 5.


User Story #2

As a user I want to be able to search my city and/or my state to find all ongoing recalls.


User Story #3
As a user I want to be able to highlight items I think I might have in my household.



Using the JSON request -> 

filter by "status": "Ongoing"


Data to showcase on page:
"recall_initiation_date" = date of recall
"city" = city
"state" = state
"product_type" = Type of Product
"product_description" = Product Description
"product_quantity" = Quantity
"code_info" = Lot Codes and Expiration dates
